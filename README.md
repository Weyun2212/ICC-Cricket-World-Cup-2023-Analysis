This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023, utilizing Python for data manipulation and visualization. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from historical tournament data, focusing on team and player performances.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes match-by-match data from the Cricket World Cup 2023 using Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights such as:

- Who were the top performers across the tournament?

- Which stadiums favoured batting or bowling conditions?

- What patterns emerged in match outcomes?

- How did players and teams perform under specific conditions?

The analysis aims to support cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and students exploring real-world sports analytics.


🧹 Data Preparation

A rigorous data preparation process was followed to ensure accurate and reliable insights.

1. Data Loading & Inspection

- Loaded dataset using Python (Pandas).

- Inspected rows, columns, and data types.

2. Handling Missing Values

- Removed incomplete rows where essential values were missing.

- Filled minor missing fields where logical.

3. Data Cleaning & Formatting

- Removed duplicates.

- Standardized columns (team names, stadium names, formats).

- Converted numeric fields to correct types.

- Ensured consistent formatting for smooth analysis.
